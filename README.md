## [Project: Banana Map (Winner of Northeastern University Hackathon 2023)](https://github.com/jwke21/team_banana_hackathon) 

**Carbon Emission and Energy calculator by various transportation routes**

The Banana Map is a web application that was created for the Northeastern University 2023 Hackathon within 24 hours. The theme for the Hackathon was "Tools of the Future" and our focus was climate change and environmental sustainability. The objective of our product is to provide incentives and day-to-day comparison for the user on their transportation choice. Transportation is the greatest contributor (~27%) of greenhouse gases emission in the United States. Hence, the first step of heading towards more sustainable life is to wisely choose our transportation option. For this project, we are comparing 4 transportation modes: driving, busing, walking, and cycling. 

For the back-end, we processed the CO2 emission dataset to get the average car mpg (miles per gallon) and CO2 emission (metric tons/mile) in Python. We also gathered resources for energy and calorie calculations. We converted those energy to equivalent number of banana needed so that users can have a tangible comparison (it is also a great source of fuel for our body!). We also showed how much area needed for a forest to sequestered the emitted CO2 (metric tons/area/day). That way, the user will get both biological and environmental comparisons. 

The front-end was built using JavaScript. We were using Mapbox API (open source) to show the map and get the distance between two addresses. The features includes trip distance calculator, CO2 emission tracking, kcal energy expenditure tracking, and equivalent banana calorie tracking. The web interface is shown below. 

Future development of this project includes cross-platform application, user rewards system (getting banana points!), and tracking other carbon saving choices such as household electricity and waste management. The development team strives for encouraging the users to make eco-friendly choices regarding their commute.

## [Project: Hoo Bank (A fully Responsive Modern Bank/Financial Service Website)](https://github.com/zz39/bank_modern_app)

The Hoo Bank is a responsive bank website page with Modern UI/UX in React JS with Tailwind that auto-fits various screen sizes, including PCs, tablets, smartphones, and more. This website contains a hero section, high-quality assets, and gradients, business stats, reusable feature sections with call-to-action buttons, testimonials, etc.

This website is deployed and configured from Azure Static App onto Azure Front Door(CDN) for optimized performance. It also has an alternative domain through DNS Management.

## [Project: Alien Invasion! (A Scrolling Shooter Arcade Game!)](https://github.com/zz39/Pygame)

This project is based on Pygame module in Python language.

In Alien Invasion, the player controls a sip that appears at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the player's ship, or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.

The games has integrated scoring statistics and movement speed control when the player reaches higher levels. The more levels the player reaches, the difficulty and the score per alien destroyed will increase.
